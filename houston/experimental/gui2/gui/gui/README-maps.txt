I have changed from Google Maps to an offline version of OpenStreetMap. To use it you must do the following:

1. Download jTileDownloader from here & run the Jar:
http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/downloading/JTileDownloader/trunk/release/jTileDownloader-0-6-1.zip

2. Select 'Bounding Box (Lat/Long)'

3. Click on 'Slippy Map Chooser'

4. Select the area around Barnes (South London). Hold down the right mouse button to pan around, and drag to select.

5. Close the map selection window

6. Select Output Zoom Level 16 from the drop-down list

7. Set the outputfolder to
(Windows) C:\Users\[username]\mapcache
(Linux) ~/mapcache

8. Click 'Download tiles'
